# Breakout

Breakout begins with four rows of bricks, with each row being a different colour. The colour order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them.
It has only two possible outcomes a win or a loss for the player.
